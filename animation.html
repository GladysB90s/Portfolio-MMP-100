            <h1>Animation Project</h1>
            <p>My goal with this project was to use it to work on my ability to create title openings for my film projects. I decided to use one of my film concepts, to create a title opening to match what I think the film should evoke. The emotions were fear and mystery. 

I used text to create the title. I used the shape I created in illustrator with the pen tool. I faded in the title using opacity and scale. I used a font I thought was strong. I faded in to try and match cinematic title openings. I used white in contrast to the black background. I brought in the writers credit using the same. I then brought in the shape pairing position and scale. I used the color red, to give the impression of blood. The red against the white font along with the word murder, paired well in my opinion. In the use of scale I had the pool of blood bleed over the entire composition background, overtaking it. 

I wanted the audience to wonder, but also use the contrasting colors to put them on edge with fear of what's coming with the use of red.
