            <h1>Audio Project</h1>
            <p>Drive slow tells the story of a woman on her way to work in the rain. We stay with her, from the walk to her car in her driveway, while she pulls off, and proceeds to have a distracting business discussion, until her crash on the road. It came to me as a scene from a film but I heard it before I saw it, which was a first for me. This is the audio interpretation of the visualization. I combined seven auto files sourced from freesound.org along with audio that was recorded by myself using my phones voice recorder (Samsung galaxy s22 ultra). I kept all sounds raw minus any effects, and instead adjusted volume. The hardest part of the piece was adjusting timing of everything. I just toyed with it until I found a length I preferred. The clips that weren’t long enough, I copy pasted, and mixed and merged. Some of the audio files sourced were perfect for my needs, they fit organically but were imperfect. I left the imperfections, because editing, or trying to soften them would take away from the source themselves, and I didn’t find it an even trade. </p>
